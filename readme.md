### 1: Thoughts on Code:

My initial thoughts about the pattern and code are positive; utilizing the repository pattern has effectively reduced code redundancy. Additionally, this approach allows for seamless integration of new requirements or features in the future. Considering the latest trends in Laravel, I would recommend adopting Actions and Services, as they enhance code readability and enable logical division of code based on specific functionalities. This approach facilitates better understanding for new developers, providing clear context for each file's purpose. Furthermore, it greatly benefits test-writing practices, as I've come across numerous informative posts on **"Medium"** discussing the advantages.

#### 2: Code Refactor

Here's my analysis of potential refactoring opportunities that can enhance code readability and align with the latest development trends.

- **Dependency Injection:** Instead of creating new class properties we can create new properties inside constructor method with access specifiers
- **Complex Conditions:** We can use php methods to match complex conditions with multiple requirments .i.e. `in_array()`.
- **Avoid Redundant Code:** Remove unnecessary variables and assignments to simplify the code.
- **Null Coalescing:** We can use null coalescing to improve code readability and it's easier to understand conditions.
- **Suggestions:** Other than this, everything seems to be fine. I'd prefer using Actions & Services Architecture because it's more user friendly and test friendly.

### 3: Tests

I've written unit tests for both files, enter comments to better understand what's the purpose of each step.

- `UserTest.php`
- `ExpireAtTest.php`
